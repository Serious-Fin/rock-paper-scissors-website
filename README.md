# rock-paper-scissors-website
A project from "The Odin Project" curriculum

# What is this project
During the "The Odin Project" curriculum there is a mini-project for a rock, paper, 
scissors website. It was designed to tech basic JavaScript and refresh HTML and 
CSS knowledge. However, I decided to turn it into a multiple-day-spanning project
to test my skills and deepen my understanding of various parts of web development.

# What I Learned
- Manipulating DOM
- Writing more complex JavaScript logic
- Connecting HTML, CSS and JS together
- Scroll snapping
- Keyframe animation
- Positioning techniques
- Using Git branches
- Using event handlers in JS
- Using JS loops

# My thoughts
I completed this project in two days. Compared to my last project, the workflow was 
fluid. I recognized which features are necessary immediately and which could be
implemented near the end. I managed to keep my code clean so I was never lost in it.

# Where to improve
- Next time I should utilize images more and not create div in a div in a div...
- Commit to git more often (make a habit)
